#   [The Complete React Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/)

[React.JS](https://reactjs.org/) is the most prominent front-end javascript framework in the modern day web development industry. With JSX, fast state management and easy integration into most modern workflows it is hard to get very far without at least gaining some awareness of this technology. The knowledge of React also extends to [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (Transpiles to both Android and iOS apps) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) (Creates desktop applications for Linux, Mac and Windows).
